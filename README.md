# Battle Tank Game

## Concept 

This is a 1v1 tank game. Players control tanks in a limited open landscape, and must shoot their opponent to destroy them. There will be a simple AI opponent and a split-screen PvP mode.
Terrain can be used for tactical advantage.
Focus: flow and feel. FUN!

## Rules

- You control the hull of the tank with the keyboard and the turret with the mouse, totally independently (the turret keeps its absolute, not relative, rotation when the hull rotates)
- You can move anywhere in the terrain, up to surrounding mountain limits
- You can fire your turret with the left mouse button
- The shot will follow a ballistics trajectory
- If the shot hits the enemy, its health is decreased
- Both players start with finite health and ammo
- When the health of a player reaches zero, his tank explodes and he loses the match
